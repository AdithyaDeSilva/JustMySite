A Blog using Django - Python Framework
============
* Created the project
* Add urls. Slugs - https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/topics/http/urls/#path-converters
* Configured URLs and view functions.
* Add templates and static files
* Dot notation to access data in an array in DTL language. And loaded the latest posts.  Injects latest posts into index page and loaded latest post with post.html template injecting those posts values(title , image , slug)
                        
                    *** Data in that array is going in this path ***
                          views.py --> index.html --> post.html 

(used a for loop and loaded those posts into index.html)  
(Added different topics into the blog for get rid of boringness)
